        <h2> Groups </h2>

        <p> I might get rid of the groups idea, mainly because I feel that it is too redundant to 
            my game, and it would be irritating as a user to have to implement the scores of each of 
            my friends each round. To enhance user experience, I feel that perhaps this section is not 
            worth it.
